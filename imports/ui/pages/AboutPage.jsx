					        	I created this site to help charities improve the 
					        	quality of the service they offer by becoming more
					        	transparent about their operations.
					        </p>
					        <p>
					        	For patrons of charities it provides clear information
					        	on the administrative and financial aspects  of the charities
					        	they support without the risk of offending by asking for it.
					        </p>

					        	For my part, I hope that you will find this site useful and 
					        	informative. Please feel free to contact me regarding the site
